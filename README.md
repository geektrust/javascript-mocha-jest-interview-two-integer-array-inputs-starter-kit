# Introduction

This is a skeleton project structure for problems that expects two integer arrays as input which will help you start solving the problem right away.

## Tools available to you.
- Node.js

## Checking for correctness 

- You can click on the `Run IO` button from the interview application, which will run your solution against some preconfigured inputs and show you the output.

## Running the project

- To run, issue the command `node . '<arr1>' '<arr2>'` where  **arr1** and **arr2** are valid arrays given in the problem statement.
- For example: `node . '[1, 2, 3]' '[10, 11, 12]'`

Note: Each full command should be wrapped in single quotes.
